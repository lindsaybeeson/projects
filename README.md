# Oh hi :wave:

I'm making some things!

## Onemonth Javascript
My homework was fun for this [course](https://onemonth.com/courses/javascript)

* **Week one:** [Funny things from my kid!](/projects/onemonth%20javascript/week%201/my%20random%20storytime/index.html)
* **Week two:** [Giphy search](/projects/onemonth%20javascript/week%202/GiphySearch/index.html)
* **Week three:** [SoundCloud player](/projects/onemonth%20javascript/week%203/SoundCloudPlayer/index.html)

### Final project: [Budget tool](/projects/onemonth%20javascript/week%204/js%20budget%20tool/index.html)
This one needs a bit of love, which it will definitely get because it's my pet project. Things I'll be working on:
* Can I get the dropdown list to load more quickly?
* The style is atrocious; I'm looking forward to making it look *good*.
* Drawing a few more charts to develop an overview of a given budget item.
* Make sure it's mobile friendly.
